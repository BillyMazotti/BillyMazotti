# Hi there, I'm Billy


## I'm a Graduate Student with Research and Internship Experience in Robotics

* 📚 I am pursuing a Masters degree in Robotics Engineering with a focus on Robotic Perception and Human-Robotic Interaction at the University of Michigan
* 💻 I am currently working on scene reconstruction and SLAM projects through courses in *Deep Learning for Robot Perception* and *Mobile Robotics*
* 🚜 I have programmed perception algorithms enhancing computational-efficiency and safety for autonomous tractor operations
* 📡 I have trained ConNets and programmed flight software for a low-Earth orbit test of an object detection system tailerd for robotic inspection of the International Space Station (Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, Mask R-CNN, YOLO)
* 🔧 **Repository Projects In Progress** 
  * UAV Trajectory Coverage in Real-World environments 
* 🐍 **Currently Learning**
  * Python (Algorithms and Data Structures)
  * C++ (Basics, OOP)

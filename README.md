# Hi there, I'm Billy


## I'm an incoming  Internship Experience in Robotics

* :books: I have a Masters in Robotics from University of Michigan where I studied/researched:
    * Robotic Perception: [iSDF_ROB599](https://github.com/BillyMazotti/iSDF_ROB599), [TwilightSLAM](https://github.com/TwilightSLAM/Twilight_SuperPoint_SLAM), [RefCOCO-3DS](https://github.com/BillyMazotti/RefCOCO-3DS)
    * Human-Robotic Interaction: [OSAM-Arm-Simulation-using-Unreal-Engine-and-ROS](https://github.com/BillyMazotti/OSAM-Arm-Simulation-using-Unreal-Engine-and-ROS/tree/main)
    * Air Traffic Management: [uav_trajectory_coverage](https://github.com/BillyMazotti/uav_trajectory_coverage)
* :robot: I have programming experience in ROS/ROS2 for C++ and Python
* :car: I have worked on path following controllers for drive-by-wire on-road vehciles
* :tractor: I have programmed perception algorithms for autonomous tractors
* :artificial_satellite: I have trained CNNs and programmed flight software for a low-Earth orbit test of an object detection system tailerd for robotic inspection of the International Space Station (Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, Mask R-CNN, YOLO)
* :wrench: **Repositories In Progress**
